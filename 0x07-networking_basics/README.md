# OSI Model and Networking Concepts

## OSI Model

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model is a conceptual framework used to understand and describe network interactions. It consists of seven layers, each responsible for specific functions to ensure seamless communication between devices.

### Layers

1. **Physical Layer:**
   - *What it is:* Deals with physical connections, such as cables and hardware.
  
2. **Data Link Layer:**
   - *How many layers it has:* 2 sub-layers - Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC).
   - *How it is organized:* Manages data frames, error detection, and MAC addressing.

3. **Network Layer:**
   - *What it is:* Focuses on logical addressing and routing.
  
4. **Transport Layer:**
   - *What it is:* Manages end-to-end communication, ensuring data integrity and flow control.
  
5. **Session Layer:**
   - *What it is:* Establishes, maintains, and terminates connections between applications.

6. **Presentation Layer:**
   - *What it is:* Translates data between the application and lower layers, ensuring compatibility.

7. **Application Layer:**
   - *What it is:* Provides network services directly to end-users and applications.

## LAN (Local Area Network)

- *Typical usage:* Connects devices within a limited geographical area, like an office or home.
- *Typical geographical size:* Small to medium-sized areas.

## WAN (Wide Area Network)

- *Typical usage:* Connects LANs over long distances.
- *Typical geographical size:* Spans cities, countries, or even continents.

## Internet

- *What it is:* A global network connecting millions of devices worldwide.

## IP Address

- *What is an IP address:* A numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network.
- *Two types of IP addresses:* IPv4 (32-bit) and IPv6 (128-bit).

## Localhost

- *What is localhost:* A loopback address (127.0.0.1) used to access the network interface of a device.

## Subnet

- *What is a subnet:* A subset of an IP network, allowing for efficient organization and management.

## IPv6

- *Why IPv6 was created:* To address the limitations of IPv4, including address exhaustion.

## TCP/UDP

- *Mainly used data transfer protocols:* TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

## TCP vs. UDP

- *Main difference:* TCP ensures reliable, ordered delivery, while UDP offers faster, connectionless communication.

## Port

- *What is a port:* A logical endpoint for communication.

## Port Numbers

- *Memorize SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS port numbers:*
  - SSH: 22
  - HTTP: 80
  - HTTPS: 443

## Network Connectivity

- *Tool/protocol for checking device connectivity:* Ping is commonly used to verify if a device is connected to a network.
